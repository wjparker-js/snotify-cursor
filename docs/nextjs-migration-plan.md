# Next.js Migration Plan & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

## Objective
Migrate the current media application from an Express/Vite backend to a unified Next.js application, leveraging Next.js API routes and features. Ensure zero downtime, no loss of functionality, and a smooth path for future features (e.g., blog system).

---

## 1. Project Preparation
- 1.1. Stakeholder alignment & requirements review
- 1.2. Audit current system (routes, middleware, integrations, static assets)
- 1.3. Inventory all API endpoints and their dependencies
- 1.4. Identify custom middleware and Express-specific logic
- 1.5. Review current deployment, CI/CD, and environment variables
- 1.6. Define success criteria and rollback plan

---

## 2. Environment & Tooling Setup
- 2.1. Ensure Next.js is installed and up-to-date
- 2.2. Set up a feature branch for migration
- 2.3. Update or create `.env.local` for Next.js
- 2.4. Configure TypeScript paths and aliases for Next.js
- 2.5. Set up linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks for Next.js

---

## 3. API Route Migration (Iterative, One Route at a Time)
- 3.1. For each Express route:
    - 3.1.1. Create corresponding Next.js API route file (e.g., `/api/auth/register` â†’ `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`)
    - 3.1.2. Refactor business logic to be framework-agnostic (move to `/lib` if needed)
    - 3.1.3. Adapt request/response handling to Next.js API conventions
    - 3.1.4. Remove Express-specific middleware (body parsing, CORS, etc.)
    - 3.1.5. Add robust error handling and logging
    - 3.1.6. Write/port unit and integration tests for each route
    - 3.1.7. Test each route in isolation (Postman/curl)
    - 3.1.8. Update frontend to use relative URLs if needed
    - 3.1.9. Remove migrated route from Express

---

## 4. Middleware & Utility Migration
- 4.1. Identify all custom middleware (auth, logging, error handling)
- 4.2. Refactor as Next.js middleware or utility functions
- 4.3. Test middleware in Next.js context

---

## 5. Static Assets & File Uploads
- 5.1. Move static assets to `/public` or configure custom handlers
- 5.2. Refactor file upload endpoints to Next.js API routes
- 5.3. Test file upload and static asset serving

---

## 6. Authentication & Session Management
- 6.1. Review current auth/session logic (JWT, cookies, etc.)
- 6.2. Integrate with Next.js API routes
- 6.3. Test login, logout, registration, and protected routes
- 6.4. Update frontend hooks/context if needed

---

## 7. Frontend Integration & Testing
- 7.1. Update all frontend API calls to use Next.js endpoints
- 7.2. Test all user flows (sign up, sign in, media upload, etc.)
- 7.3. Fix any issues with CORS, cookies, or session persistence
- 7.4. Perform cross-browser and device testing

---

## 8. Quality Assurance & Regression Testing
- 8.1. Run full test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- 8.2. Manual regression testing of all features
- 8.3. Validate error handling and edge cases
- 8.4. Review logs for unexpected errors

---

## 9. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
- 9.1. Update architecture diagrams and API docs
- 9.2. Document new API route structure and migration rationale
- 9.3. Update deployment and environment setup docs
- 9.4. Conduct knowledge transfer session with team

---

## 10. Deployment & Rollout
- 10.1. Prepare staging environment
- 10.2. Deploy migrated app to staging
- 10.3. Perform smoke tests and stakeholder review
- 10.4. Plan and execute production rollout
- 10.5. Monitor logs and metrics post-launch
- 10.6. Rollback if critical issues are detected

---

## 11. Post-Migration
- 11.1. Remove Express server and unused dependencies
- 11.2. Clean up codebase and refactor as needed
- 11.3. Plan for future features (e.g., blog system)
- 11.4. Retrospective and lessons learned
