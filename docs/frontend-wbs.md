# Frontend Modernization & Feature Implementation Plan

## 1. Design Principles & Architecture
- Modular, reusable React components
- Consistent, modern dark theme (customizable)
- Responsive layouts (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Accessibility (a11y) and keyboard navigation
- State management: React Query, Context, or Redux as needed
- Sidebar and main content always in sync/context-aware
- Easy extensibility for future features (e.g., blog, new social features)
