# Snotify Music Application - Code Review Status

## Project Overview
**Type**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Express + Prisma + MySQL music streaming application  
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - All critical issues resolved, servers running successfully  
**Last Updated**: June 20, 2025

## Current System Status
- ✅ **Frontend Server**: Running on port 3000 (React + Vite)
- ✅ **Backend Server**: Running on port 4000 (Express + Prisma)
- ✅ **Database**: MySQL connected and schema aligned
- ✅ **File Uploads**: Multer configured with organized storage structure
- ✅ **Authentication**: JWT token system working
- ✅ **Real-time**: WebSocket support implemented

## Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Database Schema Alignment ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Code referenced non-existent Prisma models (`track`, `follow`, `notification`, `activityLog`)  
**Solution**: 
- Fixed all API calls to use actual schema models (`song` instead of `track`)
- Removed references to non-existent models in WebSocket handlers
- Created complete CRUD operations for songs and albums
- Updated all route handlers to match database structure

### 2. ESM Module Compatibility ✅ FIXED  
**Issue**: Mixed CommonJS/ESNext configuration causing import issues  
**Solution**: 
- Standardized TypeScript configuration across all tsconfig files
- Ensured proper `.js` extensions in all imports
- Fixed module resolution paths

### 3. Stub Function Implementation ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Many API endpoints threw "not implemented" errors  
**Solution**: 
- Implemented complete album CRUD operations
- Added comprehensive song management endpoints
- Created proper error handling and validation

### 4. Album Cover Storage & Organization ✅ NEW FEATURE
**Issue**: Album covers stored in temp folder with generic names  
**Solution**: 
- **Organized storage structure**: Album covers now stored in `uploads/albums/{album-title}/cover.jpg`
- **Title-based folder naming**: Folders use sanitized album titles instead of IDs
- **Automatic folder creation**: System creates album-specific folders during upload
- **Path migration**: Existing covers moved to proper locations
- **Database sync**: Updated image_url references to match new structure

### 5. Automatic Track Duration Detection ✅ NEW FEATURE
**Issue**: Manual duration entry required for track uploads  
**Solution**: 
- **Automatic detection**: Uses `music-metadata` library to extract duration from audio files
- **Removed manual field**: Duration field removed from track upload form
- **Backend processing**: Server automatically derives and stores duration during upload
- **Format consistency**: Durations stored in MM:SS format

### 6. Frontend Image Loading ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Album covers not displaying until mouseover  
**Solution**: 
- Fixed API URL construction in all components
- Updated relative URLs to full backend URLs
- Implemented proper image URL helper functions
- Fixed AlbumCard, AlbumItem, and related components

### 7. Import Resolution Issues ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Vite configuration missing causing import path resolution failures  
**Solution**: 
- Restored missing `vite.config.ts` file
- Fixed path alias configuration (`@/` pointing to `src/`)
- Cleared Vite cache and restarted development servers
- Simplified problematic import chains

## Current Improvements & Features

### File Organization
- **Structured uploads**: `uploads/albums/{album-title}/` for covers, `uploads/albums/{album-title}/tracks/` for audio
- **Sanitized naming**: Album titles converted to safe folder names
- **Automatic cleanup**: Old temp files removed after migration

### Audio Processing
- **Metadata extraction**: Automatic duration, title, and artist detection from audio files
- **Format support**: MP3, WAV, FLAC, and other common audio formats
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for unsupported files

### API Endpoints
- **Albums**: Full CRUD with cover upload, title-based organization
- **Songs**: Complete management with automatic metadata
- **File serving**: Proper CORS headers and caching for media files

### User Experience
- **Instant image loading**: Album covers display immediately
- **Simplified forms**: No manual duration entry required
- **Progress feedback**: Upload progress indicators
- **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages

## Technical Stack Confirmed
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite (port 3000)
- **Backend**: Express + Prisma + MySQL (port 4000)  
- **Database**: MySQL with aligned schema
- **File Processing**: Multer + music-metadata for uploads
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support
- **Audio Processing**: Automatic metadata extraction

## File Structure
```
uploads/
├── albums/
│   ├── {album-title}/
│   │   ├── cover.jpg
│   │   └── tracks/
│   │       └── {track-files}.mp3
│   └── temp/ (for processing)
└── playlists/
    └── {playlist-files}
```

## Key Files Modified
- **Database layer**: `trackApi.ts` → `songApi.ts`, `albumApi.ts`, `songRoutes.ts`, `albumRoutes.ts`
- **Frontend components**: `AlbumCard.tsx`, `AlbumItem.tsx`, `Album.tsx`, `TrackForm.tsx`
- **Schema files**: `trackFormSchema.ts` (removed duration field)
- **Upload handling**: `albumRoutes.ts` (title-based storage)
- **Configuration**: `vite.config.ts` (restored for path resolution)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Playlist cover organization**: Apply same title-based storage to playlists
2. **Bulk upload**: Multiple track upload with batch processing
3. **Image optimization**: Automatic resize/compression for covers
4. **Metadata sync**: Sync database with audio file metadata changes
5. **Storage cleanup**: Automated cleanup of orphaned files

**Status**: All critical functionality working. Application ready for production use.

## Conclusion
The Snotify music application is now **production-ready** with all critical issues resolved. The codebase features:
- ✅ Organized file storage system with album-specific folders
- ✅ Automatic audio duration detection
- ✅ Complete database schema alignment
- ✅ Full ESM compatibility  
- ✅ Comprehensive API coverage
- ✅ Modern React architecture with TypeScript
- ✅ Robust error handling and user experience
- ✅ Smart file organization and metadata extraction

The application successfully handles music streaming, album management, playlist creation, and user authentication with a clean, maintainable codebase ready for production deployment.
